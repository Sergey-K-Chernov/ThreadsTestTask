Generate and process threads
============================

This program has been written as a test task before a job interview.

The task
--------

Create two threads.

The first one has to generate some data (two geopoints with a latitude and longitude) with a random period (200ms to 500ms).

The second one has to “process” those data with a random period (100ms to 600ms) and print the data and the processing time.
